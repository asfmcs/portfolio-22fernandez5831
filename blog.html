  As a student, programming is something that have always caught my attenton. How websites work and the "magic" behind it. Very luckily, I go to a school (American School Foundation of Monterrey) where I am offered a computers class that teaches programming!! Over the course of this past month, i've learned so much about how websites work and even made a few. So far i'm having so much fun and each day learn new codes and tricks of programming.
<br><br>
  Here are a few of the very basic HTML codes for creating your first website!

<!--you told me that I could make a table that replaces a second parragraph-->
<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th class="table-th">Tag
    <th class="table-th">Function
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="table-td"> !DOCTYPE
    <td class="table-td"> Defines the document type
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class="table-td"> html
    <td class="table-td"> Defines an HTML document
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td class="table-td"> head
    <td class="table-td"> 	Defines information about the document
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class="table-td"> title
    <td class="table-td"> Defines a title for the document
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class="table-td"> body
    <td class="table-td"> Defines the document's body
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class="table-td"> h1 to h6
    <td class="table-td"> Defines HTML headings
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class="table-td"> p
    <td class="table-td"> Defines a paragraph
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class="table-td"> br
    <td class="table-td"> Inserts a single line break
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class="table-td"> id="name-of-choice"
    <td class="table-td"> A unique element with the specified id value.
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="table-td"> class="intro important"
    <td class="table-td"> The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element.
  </tr>
  
</table>
<p id="note"><strong>Note:</strong> it is importaint that at the begginig of each tag you add a "<" and an ">" after. Then, to close it up (after writing the data it will contain)you will have to write a / before each tag.</p>

  For me personally, CSS was one of my favorite parts of making a website. With CSS one is able to make their websites more interactive and visually attractive. Coding in CSS is quite different than HTML. First off, you have to open a new section that marks where you begin your CSS. To do this you have to create a < style > tab. Then, add a selector (this can be an <a href="#id-table">id</a> or <a href="#class-table">class</a>) which identifies what it is that you want to style. After this, you are able to chose from a very broad selection of options.

<p>Every Cascading Style Sheet (whether it is contained in a .css file, or embedded in the head element of an HTML document) is a series of instructions called statements. A statement does two things: it identifies the elements in an HTML document that it affects. <em>Westciv.com</em>
